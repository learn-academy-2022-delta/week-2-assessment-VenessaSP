# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: Parameters are used in creating and declaring a function. While arguments are used when invoking the function.

  Researched answer: Function parameters specify a single or list of variables when declaring a function. Function arguments are passing/assigning value to a declared function when invoked. 



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: getorDefault uses the key value and general purpose is a static method

  Researched answer: General purpose the key and value  components that have to be put in. getorDefault is the output value to the corresponding key and if there is none it can simply be returned so the general purpose is required 



3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: .map is a higher order function that iterates through every element in an array, while .filter is a high order function that loops through every element. 

  Researched answer: Both are higher order functions .map affects every element in the array and returns different values but the same length, .filter affects different elements of the array based on the guidelines given and length differs.



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: Methods are built-in and are actions used on objects

  Researched answer: Specific built-in function definitions that perform actions on specific data types. 



5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Creating a defined pathway through a nested object.

  Researched answer: Extracts data and values from objects and creates a new variable. 



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Being able to type a function variable without declaring it. 

  Researched answer: Moving variables to the top of the scope by default and using it without declaring.
